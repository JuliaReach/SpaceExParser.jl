## Introduction

```@contents
Pages = ["examples.md"]
Depth = 3
```

The folder `/examples` contains a collection of model files that are available from different
sources:

- [SpaceEx webpage](http://spaceex.imag.fr/download-6), small selection of
  examples that is part of the VM Server distribution and can be executed directly
  from the SpaceEx web interface.

### Remarks

The examples consist of single hybrid automata that are constructed via flattening (parallel composition). This can be done via SpaceEx executable file with the command

`spaceex -g name.cfg -m name.xml --output-system-file new_name.xml`

However, note that the flattening process changes the original model and may induce parsing errors. The parsing errors only appear when the constructed model is visualized/analyzed with the Model Editor or/and the Web Interface. There are no parsing errors with the source code/executable SpaceEx. A list of identified parsing problems follows below.

1. Special symbols, e.g. `~`, `_` in the variable and location names
2. Special characters, e.g. Greek or Russian letters
3. Nondeterministic flows, e.g. `x'==x+w1`, where `0<w1<0.1` (see `bball_nondet`)
4. Nondeterministic resets, e.g. `v' == -0.75*v+w2` (see `bball_nondet`)
5. Naming issues, e.g. default variable name is component.subcomponent.variable

The aforementioned problems would yield errors/warnings when parsed.

```
1. ERROR | in component 'osc_w_4th_order' the string 'osc.osci.hop'
doesn't match NAME pattern [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]* >>> element
label removed

2. Error: name="pp-always-always-always-always" value doesn't match
NAME pattern [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*>>> set to default: "unnamed"

3. ERROR |  new LOCATION with name= 'unnamed'; name already exist,
renamed in 'unnamed2'

4. ERROR: Failed to parse model file phpxbMjAb.xml.
caused by: Could not parse base component system.
caused by: Failed to parse flow of location always.
caused by: Could not parse predicate

5. Constructed Reset: x' == x & v' == -0.75*v with offset
support_function ( w1 >= -0.0499999 & w1 <= 0.0499999 &
w2 >= -0.0999999 & w2 <= 0.0999999, mapped by x' == 0 & v' == w2 )

6. Constructed Flow:  x' == v & v' == -0.999999 with offset
support_function(x >= 0 & SLACK2 <= 0.0999999 & SLACK2 >= 0 &
SLACK4 <= 0.199999 & SLACK4 >= 0, mapped by x' == 0 & v' == -SLACK2+0.0499999 )
```
