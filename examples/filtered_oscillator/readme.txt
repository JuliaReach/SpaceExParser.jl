This benchmark models a two-dimensional switched oscillator connected to
filter that smooths the output signal. The models are parameterized
over the order (number of 1st-order differential equations) of the
filter.

The oscillator is modeled with 4 locations and 2 continuous variables,
x and y. The filter is a purely continuous system that takes as input
the value of x, and outputs a smoothened signal z, which depends on x
via a k-th order system of 1st-order linear differential equations.
The combined system has 4 locations and 2+k continuous variables.
