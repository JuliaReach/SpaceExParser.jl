This dictionary is then stored in the extension field (ext) of the hybrid system.\nThe transition labels are stored in the extension field (ext) of the hybrid system.\nWe use the location \"id\" field (an integer), such that each of the vectors modes, resetmaps and switchings corresponds to the location with the given \"id\". For example, modes[1] corresponds to the mode for the location with id=\"1\".\nThe name field of a location is ignored.\nThe nature of the switchings is autonomous. If there are guards, these define state-dependent switchings only. Switching control functions are not yet implemented.\nThe resetmaps field consists of the vector of tuples (assignment, guard), for each location.\n\nThese comments apply whenever raw_dict=false:\n\nThe field variables is an ordered dictionary, where the order is given by the insertion order. This allows deterministic iteration over the dictionary, (notice that in a usual dictionary, the order in which the elements are returned does not correspond, in general, to the order in which the symbols were saved). The variables are stored in the coefficients matrix using this insertion order.\nIf ST is nothing, the modes are given as the vector of tuples (flows, invariants), each component being a list of expressions, and similarly the reset maps are the vector of tuples (assignments, guards).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/methods/#SX.linearHS","page":"Methods","title":"SX.linearHS","text":"linearHS(HDict; ST=ConstrainedLinearControlContinuousSystem,                 STD=ConstrainedLinearControlDiscreteSystem,                 N=Float64, kwargs...)\n\nConvert the given hybrid system objects into a concrete system type for each node, and Julia expressions into SymEngine symbolic expressions.\n\nInput\n\nHDict – raw dictionary of hybrid system objects\nST    – (optional, default: ConstrainedLinearControlContinuousSystem)            assumption for the type of mathematical system for each mode\nSTD   – (optional, default: ConstrainedLinearControlDiscreteSystem)             assumption for the type of mathematical system for the assignments and guards\nN     – (optional, default: Float64) numeric type of the system's coefficients\n\nOutput\n\nThe tuple (modes, resetmaps).\n\nNotes\n\n\"Controlled\" variables are interpreted as state variables (there is an ODE flow  for them), otherwise these are interpreted as input variables (there is not an  ODE for them).\nIf the system has nonlinearities, then some first order derivatives cannot be evaluated to numbers, and this function does not apply. In that case, you will see the error message: ArgumentError: symbolic value cannot be evaluated to a numeric value.\nWe assume that inequalities in invariants are of the form ax <= b or ax >= b, where b is a scalar value. Other combinations are NOT yet supported.\nIn inequalities, x is a vector of variables of two differens types only: either all of them are state variables, or all of them are input variables.
