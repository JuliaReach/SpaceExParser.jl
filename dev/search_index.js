The keys of this dictionary are:\n\nautomaton\nvariables\ntransitionlabels\ninvariants\nflows\nassignments\nguards\nswitchings\nnlocations\nntransitions\n\nNotes\n\nCurrently, this function makes the following assumptions:\n\nThe model contains only 1 component. If the model contains more than 1 component, an error is raised. In this case, recall that network components can be flattened using sspaceex.\nThe default and a custom ST parameter assume that all modes are of the same type. In general, you may pass a vector of system's types in kwargs (not implemented).\n\nMoreover, let us note that:\n\nThe tags `<notes> ... <\n\notes>` are ignored.\n\nVariable names are stored in the dictionary variables, together with other information such as if the variable is controlled or not. This dictionary is then stored in the extension field (ext) of the hybrid system.\nThe transition labels are stored in the extension field (ext) of the hybrid system.\nWe use the location \"id\" field (an integer), such that each of the vectors modes, resetmaps and switchings corresponds to the location with the given \"id\". For example, modes[1] corresponds to the mode for the location with id=\"1\".\nThe name field of a location is ignored.\nThe nature of the switchings is autonomous. If there are guards, these define state-dependent switchings only. Switching control functions are not yet implemented.\nThe resetmaps field consists of the vector of tuples (assignment, guard), for each location.\n\nThese comments apply whenever raw_dict=false:\n\nThe field variables is an ordered dictionary, where the order is given by the insertion order. This allows deterministic iteration over the dictionary, (notice that in a usual dictionary, the order in which the elements are returned does not correspond, in general, to the order in which the symbols were saved). The variables are stored in the coefficients matrix using this insertion order.\nIf ST is nothing, the modes are given as the vector of tuples (flows, invariants), each component being a list of expressions, and similarly the reset maps are the vector of tuples (assignments, guards).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/methods/#SpaceExParser.linearHS","page":"Methods","title":"SpaceExParser.linearHS","text":"linearHS(HDict; ST=ConstrainedLinearControlContinuousSystem,\n         STD=ConstrainedLinearControlDiscreteSystem,\n         kwargs...)\n\nConvert the given hybrid-system object into a concrete system type for each mode, and convert Julia expressions into SymEngine symbolic expressions.\n\nInput\n\nHDict – raw dictionary of hybrid system objects\nST    – (optional, default: ConstrainedLinearControlContinuousSystem)            assumption for the type of mathematical system for each mode\nSTD   – (optional, default: ConstrainedLinearControlDiscreteSystem)             assumption for the type of mathematical system for the assignments and guards\n\nOutput\n\nThe tuple (modes, resetmaps).\n\nNotes\n\n\"Controlled\" variables are interpreted as state variables (there is an ODE flow  for them), otherwise these are interpreted as input variables (there is not an  ODE for them).\nIf the system has nonlinearities, then some first order derivatives cannot be evaluated to numbers, and this function does not apply. In that case, you will see the error message: ArgumentError: symbolic value cannot be evaluated to a numeric value.\nWe assume that inequalities in invariants are of the form ax <= b or ax >= b, where b is a scalar value. Other combinations are NOT yet supported.\nIn inequalities, x is a vector of variables of two different types only: either all of them are state variables, or all of them are input variables. Other combinations are not yet allowed.\nStrict and non-strict inequalities are treated as being the same: both are mapped to half-spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/methods/#SpaceExParser.count_locations_and_transitions","page":"Methods","title":"SpaceExParser.count_locations_and_transitions","text":"count_locations_and_transitions(root_sxmodel)\n\nReturns the number of locations and transitions for each component.\n\nInput\n\nroot_sxmodel – the root element of a SpaceEx file\n\nOutput\n\nTwo vectors of integers (lcount, tcount), where the i-th entry of lcount and tcount are the number of locations and transitions, respectively, of the i-th component.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/methods/#SpaceExParser.parse_sxmath","page":"Methods","title":"SpaceExParser.parse_sxmath","text":"parse_sxmath(s; assignment=false)\n\nReturns the list of expressions corresponding to a given SpaceExParser string.\n\nInput\n\ns          – string\nassignment – (optional, default: false)\n\nOutput\n\nVector of expressions, equations or inequalities.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> using SpaceExParser: parse_sxmath\n\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"x >= 0\")\n1-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(x >= 0)\n\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"x' == x & v' == -0.75*v\")\n2-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(x' = x)\n :(v' = -0.75v)\n\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"x == 0 & v <= 0\")\n2-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(x = 0)\n :(v <= 0)\n\nParentheses are ignored:\n\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"(x == 0) & (v <= 0)\")\n2-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(x = 0)\n :(v <= 0)\n\nSplitting is also performend over double ampersand symbols:\n\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"x == 0 && v <= 0\")\n2-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(x = 0)\n :(v <= 0)\n\nIf you want to parse an assignment, use the assignment flag:\n\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"x := -x*0.1\", assignment=true)\n1-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(x = -x * 0.1)\n\nCheck that we can parse expressions involving parentheses:\n\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"(t <= 125 & y>= -100)\")\n2-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(t <= 125)\n :(y >= -100)\njulia> parse_sxmath(\"t <= 125 & (y>= -100)\")\n2-element Vector{Expr}:\n :(t <= 125)\n :(y >= -100)\n\nAlgorithm\n\nFirst a sanity check (assertion) is made that the expression makes a coherent use of parentheses.\n\nThen, the following steps are done (in the given order):\n\nsplit the string with the & key, or &&\nremove trailing whitespace of each substring\nreplace double == with single =\ndetect unbalanced parentheses (beginning and final subexpressions) and in that case delete them\ncast to a Julia expression with parse\n\nNotes\n\nFor assignments, the nomenclature := is also valid and here it is replaced to =, but you need to set assignment=true for this replacement to take effect.\n\nThe characters '(' and ')' are deleted (replaced by the empty character), whenever it is found that there are unbalanced parentheses after the expression is split into subexpressions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/methods/#SpaceExParser.parse_sxmodel!","page":"Methods","title":"SpaceExParser.parse_sxmodel!","text":"parse_sxmodel!(root_sxmodel, HDict)\n\nInput\n\nroot_sxmodel – root element of an XML document\nHDict        – dictionary that wraps the hybrid model and contains the keys                   (automaton, variables, transitionlabels, invariants, flows,                   assignments, guards, switchings, nlocations, ntransitions)\n\nOutput\n\nThe HDict dictionary.\n\nNotes\n\nEdge labels are not used and their symbol is (arbitrarily) set to the integer 1.\nLocation identifications (\"id\" field) are assumed to be integers.\nThe switchings types are assumed to be autonomous.
